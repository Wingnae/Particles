# Particles

A personal project from March 2017 with particles and basic Newtonian physics 

Mostly for aesthetic purpose rather than a very realistic simulation as there is no collisions.

Display 1M particles on GTX 960M and i5-6300HQ.
Could be optimized further with some algorithm ameliorations and by using pure OpenGL but I didn't know it at the time.
